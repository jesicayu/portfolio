    text: "My background in architecture and UX did two crucial things: enhance my abilities as a full stack software developer and provide me with skills that many developers might not possess.\nIn architecture, I was trained to think critically and creatively to solve complex problems while dealing with multi-layered systems. Being meticulous with my work and anticipating how a small change in the system might affect the other parts was second nature. As a result, I approach development with thoroughness and precision, striving to create organized and maintainable code.\nMeanwhile, my experience in UX enabled me to take a holistic approach to design and consider the broader context of users' goals before diving into details. This sensibility combined with my ability to communicate my ideas visually through sketches and collaborate with professionals from other disciplines proved to be essential skills that shaped me into a better programmer.",
