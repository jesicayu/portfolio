    text: "Hello! I'm full-stack software developer with a deep curiosity for understanding how things work - whether it's diving into npm dependency resolution or tracing the intricate flow of processes in Laravel’s queue system. The drive to go beyond surface level has allowed me to become a versatile and adaptable developer. \n My journey into software development has been enriched by my background in architecture and UX. Architecture taught me to anticipate how small changes can impact entire systems, while UX emphasized understanding the broader context of users’ goals before diving into details. Today, I thrive in evolving environments, building scalable systems, optimizing user experiences, and streamlining processes. \n Looking ahead, I’m eager to bring this versatility and curiosity to a team committed to making an objectively positive impact on human lives, prioritizing solutions that are unambiguously good—making a genuine difference.",
